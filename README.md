- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @skullknight99
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in looksmaxxin, fitness (will get a personal trainer certificate soon ;)), anime/manga, and i've played a couple of videogames that got me interested in coding
  specially after discovering how dll files work.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C/C++ and Python mainly, i'm pretty much intermediate level at python but i'll be needing C for the time being so i'll be focusing on it.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... don't use social media, go touch some grass.
